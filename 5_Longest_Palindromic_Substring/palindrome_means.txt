Make sure you understand what a palindrome means.

A palindrome is a string which reads the same in both directions. 

For example, SSS = "aba" is a palindrome, 
SSS = "abc" is not.


a word or group of words that is the same when you read it forwards from the beginning or backwards from the end
回文（順讀和倒讀都一樣的詞、詩句等）
"Refer" and "level" are palindromes.
refer 和 level 是回文詞。
